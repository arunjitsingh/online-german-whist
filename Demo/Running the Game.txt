Running the game on a single computer:
You will need:
ONE running instance of the server (execute "German Whist Server (Stand-alone).jar")
TWO running instances of the client (execute "German Whist/German Whist.jar" twice)

On the server...
Leave everything to the defaults and click "Start Server". If there is a port error, change the port number and restart the server.

On the client...
Click on "Log in". In the new window, enter:
user name : (any)
server    : 127.0.0.1
port      : 5335 (default), or the one specified in the server application.
Click "Log in"
Logging in errors will appear at the bottom of the log-in window.
The two clients connecting to the server must have a different name.

When both users are successfully logged in to the server, the game begins.

Enjoy!
